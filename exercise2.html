		<ul>
			<li>4 cups of rice</li>
			<li>8 cups of water</li>
			<li>Large pot with lid</li>
		</ul>
		
		<ol>
			<li>To wash away excess starch, measure rice into a pot and pour in enough cold water to cover the grains. Gently swish the rice with your fingers and rub lightly. Pour out the starchy water (you can pour through a sieve so you don't lose any grains). Repeat 1 or 2 times, depending on how starchy the rice is. The water does not have to be completely clear after the final wash.</li>
			<li>After pouring out the water for the last time, add clean water to the pot (add 1-1/2 to 2 cups of water for 1 cup rice)</li>		
			<li>Cover the pot and bring to a boil, then turn down the heat to its lowest setting. Let the rice gently simmer for 18 to 20 minutes.</li>
			<li>Remove the pot from the heat and let the rice continue to steam in the covered pot for 5 minutes.</li>
			<li>Remove the lid and lift (do not stir) rice from the bottom and sides to separate keep rice from sticking to the bottom of the pot.</li>
