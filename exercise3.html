      To wash away excess starch, measure rice into a pot and pour in enough cold water to cover the grains. Gently swish the rice with your fingers and rub lightly. Pour out the starchy water (you can pour through a sieve so you don't lose any grains). Repeat 1 or 2 times, depending on how starchy the rice is. The water does not have to be completely clear after the final wash.</li>

      <li>ADD WATER<br>

      After pouring out the water for the last time, add clean water to the pot (add 1-1/2 to 2 cups of water for 1 cup rice)</li>
