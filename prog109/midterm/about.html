				<h3>About Me</h3>
              <p>
                Hello! My name is Nina Pham and I am currently studying 
                Information Systems and Technology with a Business 
                Intelligence concentration at Bellevue College. 
                I currently work as Technical Trainer in my company's IT department. 
                My job is to help users learn the new operating system (SAP)
                as we sunset the old one. Basically, I am responsible for creating
                and delivering training content to employees across our network. 
                But I also juggle many projects with different 
                departments. I often find myself helping with Development, 
                Accounting, and Administration. My goal is to use my bachelor's degree 
                to advance my career, whether that is to move up in the company I work at or find 
                better job in the industry. 
              </p>
