  <h3>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</h3>
  <p>I was introduced to HTML in 2002 in elementary school. 
    I believe XHTML was used during that time. After that, 
    I continued to use basic knowledge of HTML to edit 
    my own social networking websites after that. 
    As you can tell, my background was very limited.</p>
  
  <h3>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</h3>
  <p>I did not build it entirely from scratch, because the layout was CSS code I used for previous assignment that I submitted.  
    However, I did used my own work as a template.</p>
 
<h3>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)</h3>
  <p>The most challenging part was building the Artifacts page. 
    There were a few more steps compared to the other pages and therefore it took longer to complete.
    For example, we were required to add images and links. It's important that I spend some time to validate these. </p>
  
  <h3>How taking this class changed your view on Web Development? </h3>
  <p> Learning about web development was really fun but it wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be.
    At least, not compared to the other languages I've learned like C#, SQL, or Python. 
    The last chapter gave me a new perspective as it sheds light on usability and accessibility. That was something we 
    have not discussed or brought up in the other languages. Since the world wide web can be used by so many people, it is important
    to be mindful of users who have disabilities. Especially during the pandemic, everyone from businesses
    to families have been relying on web. It needs to be accessible more than ever. 
  
  <h3>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</h3>
  <p>I recommend students reach out and work with others. Whether it's collaborating with other students
    or asking the teacher directly for help, it's a crucial part of your online learning experience. You are not alone, so don't just submit
    your work and call it a day. Help others or be helped by others, and in that way you can expand your own knowledge. Because each time you
    learn something and get to explain it, you can deepen your understanding of the subject at hand.
